# Signnow ETL

The purpose of this project is to show how one can utilize services which are offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to orchestrate an ETL process to extract data from Signnow and store in a database. Signnow is a platform that allows individuals and business to sign and send documents online. This ETL process retrieves information of signed documents from a given period of time, stores it in a relational database, and save the actual document to S3.
